# Technology

At Thomas we primarily use React for frontend Engineering and for the most productive interview experience we recommend you carry out the test in that technology.

If you feel more comfortable using a different JavaScript based technology (such as Angular), we will accommodate this choice though the experience for candidate and interviewer may not be optimal given potential mismatch in experience.

# Approach

Implement the stories in any order you see fit, though the order listed above is at least partially prioritised with room for your own personal discretion.

We recommend spending no more than half a day (spread over the course of a week) but you are free to do as little or as much as you like - ultimately you need to feel comfortable to discuss your solution and code in an interview with one of our senior Engineers.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us via your contact at Thomas, recruiter, or directly through the email address associated with this GitHub team on the main page.

Good luck!
