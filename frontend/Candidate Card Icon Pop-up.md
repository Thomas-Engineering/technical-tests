# User Story

As an
    Administrator
So that
    I can quickly access more detail on when the assessments have been sent and completed
I want
    A pop-up showing the sent and (if available) completed date of the assessment when I click or tap the icon

# Acceptance Criteria

## AC1

Given
    That the assessment has been sent to a candidate
When
    I click or tap the appropriate icon
Then
    I want to see a pop-up with the sent date

## AC2

Given
    That the assessment has been both sent to and completed by a candidate
When
    I click or tap the appropriate icon
Then
    I want to see a pop-up with the sent and completed dates
