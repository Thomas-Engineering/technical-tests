# User Story

**As an** Administrator **I want** to be able to page through very long lists of candidates **so that** when there are potentially 100s of candidates I do not get an extremely long and overwhelming view of them

# Acceptance Criteria

## AC1

**Given** that there are <=10 candidates **when** I view the page **then** I should still see the pagination but it should be greyed out and only show 1 page available and selected

  ## AC2

**Given** that there are >10 candidates **when** I view the page **then** I want to see how many pages of candidates there are (up to 3 numbers), with more (or less) represented with an elipses (...).

## AC3

**Given** that I am on the first page of candidates **when** I view the page **then** I want the "First" button to be greyed out

## AC4

**Given** that I am on the last page of candidates **when** I view the page **then** I want the "Last" button to be greyed out
