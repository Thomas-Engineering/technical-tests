# User Story

**As an** Administrator **I want** to be able to filter candidates by the assessments they have been sent **so that** when there are potentially 100s of candidates, I can easily refine the list down to specific assessment types

# Acceptance Criteria

## AC1

**Given** that there are >1 candidates **when** I click or tap the appropriate filter button **then** the list view should be limited to just those candidates
