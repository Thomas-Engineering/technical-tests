# User Story

As an 
    Administrator
I want 
    To be able to filter candidates by the assessments they have been sent
So that 
    When there are potentially 100s of candidates, I can easily refine the list down to specific assessment types

# Acceptance Criteria

## AC1

Given
    That there are >1 candidates
When
    I click or tap the appropriate filter button
Then
    The list view should be limited to just those candidates
