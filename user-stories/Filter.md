# User Story

**As an** Administrator<br> 
**So that** I can easily limit the list to specific assessments when there are potentially hundreds of candidates<br>
**I want** to be able to filter candidates by the assessments they have been sent

## Acceptance Criteria

**Given** that there are candidates with sent assessments<br>
**When** I click or tap the appropriate filter(s)<br>
**Then** the candidate summary should be limited to just those candidates
