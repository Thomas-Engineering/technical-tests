# Thomas: Engineering - Technical Tests
## Introduction
This repo is the home of our do-it-in-your-own-time technical tests. The intention is to allow candidates looking to join Engineering@Thomas the time and space to present their best selves in interview. We recognise that any sort of technical work undertaken in an unrealistic and pressurised environment is going to lead to poor results and not be reflective of actual performance and capabilities day-to-day.

Upon completion of the test, our team will review your code ahead of your face-to-face interview to give them time to structure relevant questions and discussion so that the interview is as productive as possible.

If you have any questions or concerns, do get in touch with us here either [directly](mailto:engineering@gthomas.co.uk "mailto: Engineering") or through your contact with us and we look forward to seeing how you get on!

## What's in the Repo

Everything needed for either a frontend or backend implementation of a small sample project.

- User stories:
    - Candidate Card Overview
    - Candidate Card Icon Pop-up
    - Basic List View
    - Search
    - Filter
    - Pagination
- Mocks
    - UX Design example
    - Candidate data
- Icons for the frontend implementation

## Approach

Whether you're developing at the front or the back, one set of user stories drives both implementations. Implement the stories in any order you see fit, though the order listed above is at least partially prioritised with room for your own personal discretion.

We recommend spending no more than half a day (spread over the course of a week) but you are free to do as little or as much as you like - ultimately you need to feel comfortable to discuss your solution and code in an interview with several of our engineers.

Ahead of a  face-to-face interview our team would like at least a day to review your code, so please commit it to a public repo (e.g. GitHub) and let your contact know when it's available. For the deployable, you can either:

- deploy to the cloud on a public facing endpoint
- bring your own device to run locally (for screen sharing, please install [Zoom](https://zoom.us/download "Zoom's download link") prior to arriving)

You'll then undertake a code review with 2-3 members of the team after a short demonstration of your working solution.

### Implementation

For the technical test we recommend you attempt to align with the technologies chosen by the team (as that's typically what you'll be using day-to-day). We can accommodate other technologies, but for the most productive interview experience it helps if both sides have a similar level of comprehension.

#### Frontend

Implementing the user stories from a frontend perspective, producing a working single page application (SPA) that closely follows the mock UI design and is driven by the mock candidate data.

Where appropriate and as your skills allow, attempt to use the following technologies:

- React
- JavaScript (plain-old or TypeScript)
- CSS (SASS)

#### Backend

Implement the user stories from a backend perspective, producing a working API intended to be consumed by a frontend application designed to a contract defined by the mock candidate data.

Where appropriate and as your skills allow, attempt to use the following technologies:

- C# (.Net Core)
- REST
- Data storage (either the mock data file, or a storage medium of your choosing)
