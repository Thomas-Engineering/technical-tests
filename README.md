# Thomas International: Technical Tests

This repo is the home of our do-it-in-your-own-time technical tests. The intention is to allow any potential candidates looking to join Engineering@Thomas the time and space to present their best selves to us in interview and we recognise that any sort of technical work undertaken in an unrealistic and pressurised environment is going to lead to poor results and not be reflective of your actual performance and capabilities.

Candidates looking to complete the technical tests in this repo are encouraged to spend no more than half a day (spread out over a week at most) - after all you're doing a test and not free work for us.

When completed ahead of a scheduled face-to-face interview, you can either bring your executable solution in on your own device, or we'll work with you to get it running on one of our machines so you can demonstrate your work and then undertake a code review with one of our senior Engineers - this will form the basis of your interview.

To-date we are only covered frontend work with these tests, with more planned to come for other disciplines in the future.

We look forward to seeing what you put forward!
