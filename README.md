# Thomas International: Technical Tests

This repo is the home of our do-it-in-your-own-time technical tests. The intention is to allow any potential candidates looking to join Engineering@Thomas the time and space to present their best selves to us in interview and we recognise that any sort of technical work undertaken in an unrealistic and pressurised environment is going to lead to poor results and not be reflective of your actual performance and capabilities.

Candidates looking to complete the technical tests in this repo are encouraged to spend no more than half a day (spread out over a week at most) - after all you're doing a test and not free work for us.

When completed ahead of a scheduled face-to-face interview, you can either bring your executable solution in on your own device, or we'll work with you to get it running on one of our machines so you can demonstrate your work and then undertake a code review with one of our senior Engineers - this will form the basis of your interview.

To-date we are only covered frontend work with these tests, with more planned to come for other disciplines in the future.

We look forward to seeing what you put forward!

# Technology

At Thomas we primarily use React for frontend Engineering and for the most productive interview experience we recommend you carry out the test in that technology.

If you feel more comfortable using a different JavaScript based technology (such as Angular), we will accommodate this choice though the experience for candidate and interviewer may not be optimal given potential mismatch in experience.

# Approach

Implement the stories in any order you see fit, though the order listed above is at least partially prioritised with room for your own personal discretion.

We recommend spending no more than half a day (spread over the course of a week) but you are free to do as little or as much as you like - ultimately you need to feel comfortable to discuss your solution and code in an interview with one of our senior Engineers.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us via your contact at Thomas, recruiter, or directly through the email address associated with this GitHub team on the main page.

Good luck!
